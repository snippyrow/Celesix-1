# Celesix-1

This is a little kernel program written earlier, used for getting all the accidents out of my system. Hopefully now I can try to create a real system!

This little kernel includes a basic ATA reader, a small shell, as well as a basic CLI. I am now re-doing it using what I have learned through making this.
